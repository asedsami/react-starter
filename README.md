Simple starter kit for React.js including HMR, Source Maps and Service Worker for offline support. it's using PouchDB to save some stuff on the browser which needs to get improved but I'm not removing that part of the code so when I start a new React app, I can use them as a guide.


```terminal
npm watch
```
